    This module aims to store an implicit skeleton handle its blending 
    and evaluate it.
    It can be used by the implicit skinning algorithm for instance. 
    (which projects a skinned  mesh vertices onto the implicit surface)
    This evaluation)
    
    It's important to keep this module as independant as possible. This
    way extracting it to make a library will be easier.
