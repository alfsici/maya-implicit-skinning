MDD file format
The MDD file format is very simple and here is a brief description for TD's and developers who are interested in adding tools to a pipeline built around MDD.

The first thing to note is that the MDD file format is Motorola Big Endian byte order as opposed to the Intel Little Endian standard. 
So however you implement the structure below, you must come up with an algorithm to flip the bytes during file IO.

The data structure is like so:
typedef Struct{
int totalframes;
int totalPoints;
float *Times; //time for each frame
float **points[3];
}mddstruct;


and the data is written like so:


totalframes
totalPoints
Times
while(!totalframes)
{
while(!totalPoints)
{
write point[frame][point][axis];
point++;
}
frame++;
}
