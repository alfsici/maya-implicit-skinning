.PC2 File Format:

You can create or modify PointCache2 files by hand using the following file format. The start of the file is a header containing:
char    cacheSignature[12];   // Will be 'POINTCACHE2' followed by a trailing null character.
int     fileVersion;          // Currently 1
int     numPoints;            // Number of points per sample
float   startFrame;           // Corresponds to the UI value of the same name.
float   sampleRate;           // Corresponds to the UI value of the same name.
int     numSamples;           // Defines how many samples are stored in the file.
Be sure to check the version number. If it isn't 1, then don't mess with the file, as the format will change in the future.

Following the header, there is a straight dump of all the cache samples (which are snapshots of all the point positions for an object). Each sample is stored one after the other as a flat array of x/y/z floats for each point (so each sample is (numPoints * sizeof(float) * 3) bytes).

See the included "PointCacheWriter.ms" script as an example.
